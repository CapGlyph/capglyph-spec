# Documentation rules

1. Repository-owned documentation is English-only.
2. `sigil-docs` is the canonical design and governance corpus. This repository owns implementation evidence and repository-local developer instructions.
3. Distinguish normative requirements, accepted decisions, candidates, open questions, and implemented behavior. A file or plan is not implementation.
4. Synchronize affected `sigil-docs` architecture, security, public behavior, configuration, compatibility, reference, developer, risk, and decision documents in the same delivery.
5. Link to one authoritative definition instead of copying a divergent contract into source comments, tests, or local documents.
6. Public commands, fields, templates, errors, defaults, and limits require implementation and test evidence from the owning revision.
7. Documentation status must stay honest throughout implementation. Candidate text cannot authorize code by itself.
8. Record cross-crate docs tasks and ordering in CarryCtx; stale affected documentation keeps the implementation task incomplete.
9. Formal repository references use the canonical organization URL `https://github.com/CapGlyph/capglyph-cli`.
